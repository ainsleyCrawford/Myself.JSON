# Myself.JSON
This repository includes a text file in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, [myself.json](https://github.com/ainsleyCrawford/Myself.json/blob/master/myself.json), and the same code between two `<script>` tags of an html file, [myself.html](https://github.com/ainsleyCrawford/Myself.json/blob/master/myself.html). The purpose of this repository is to practise writing JSON syntax, defining JavaScript objects and accessing those objects with JavaScript methods. 

I used myself as the basis for this project, thus the titie. I used my curriculum vitae as an aid to express my profile (summary, skills, education and interests) as key–⁠element pairs that each hold a datum or an array of data.

Beyond returning object properties, this JavaScript code makes use of a ternary if statement<sup>1</sup>, JSON's `stringify` function<sup>2</sup> and the JavaScript string methods `toLowerCase()`<sup>3</sup> and `replace()`<sup>2</sup>.
